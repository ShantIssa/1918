 heavy_field_gun_equipment_1:0 "Siege Artillery"
 heavy_field_gun_equipment_1_desc:0 "Siege Artillery (also siege guns or siege cannons) are heavy guns designed to bombard fortifications, cities, and other fixed targets. They are distinct from field artillery and are a class of siege weapon capable of firing heavy cannonballs or shells that required enormous transport and logistical support to operate. They lacked mobility and thus were rarely useful in more mobile warfare situations, generally having been superseded by large-calibre artillery such as heavy howitzers."
 heavy_field_gun_equipment_2:0 "Heavy Artillery"
 heavy_field_gun_equipment_2_desc:0 "As the First World War settled into Trench Warfare on the Western Front the light field guns that the combatants went to war with were beginning to show their limitations when facing an enemy who was now dug into prepared positions. Indirect fire, interdiction and counter-battery fire emphasized the importance of long-range heavy artillery."
 heavy_field_gun_equipment_3:0 "Advanced Heavy Artillery"
 heavy_field_gun_equipment_3_desc:0 "Interest in an improved siege gun waned until the Russo-Japanese War, during which the Japanese Army used coastal mortars brought from Japan to end the 11-month long Siege of Port Arthur. Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, Chief of the General Staff saw the utility of a newer, larger siege gun and in 1906, he instructed the Artillerieprüfungskommission to conduct further evaluation of the Beta-Gerät. After initial difficulties with penetration, the 42cm Gamma-Gerät was accepted into the German Army."
 heavy_field_gun_equipment_4:0 "Interwar Heavy Artillery"
 heavy_field_gun_equipment_4_desc:0 "Due to their extreme weights, the WW1 largest artillery pieces (such as the 42cm Gamma-Gerät) were mostly immobile and had a limited effectiveness. However, some Heavy Howitzer concepts were studied during the Interwar Period. The objective was to destroy fortified installations while keeping a certain maneuverability and be able to shoot new ammunition types."
