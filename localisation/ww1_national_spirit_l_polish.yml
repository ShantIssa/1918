 ww1_Scramble_for_Africa_desc:0 "Rywalizacja między Wielką Brytanią, Francją, Niemcami i innymi potęgami europejskimi w dużej mierze wiąże się z napięciami między wielkimi mocarstwami w tej epoce. Ponieważ tylko fragmenty terytorium pozostały niezkolonizowane, żądania przyłączenia obcych kolonii zaczynają już odbijać się echem na naszych ulicach."

 German_staff_ww1:0 "Niemiecki sztab"
 German_staff_ww1_desc:0 "The German Army, responsible for the continuous study of all aspects of war, and for drawing up and reviewing plans for mobilization or campaign. It existed unofficially from 1806, and was formally established by law in 1814, the first general staff in existence. It was distinguished by the formal selection of its officers by intelligence and proven merit rather than patronage or wealth, and by the exhaustive and rigorously structured training which its staff officers undertook. Its rise and development gave the German armed forces a decisive strategic advantage over their adversaries for nearly a century and a half."
 Austrian_staff:0 "Austriacki sztab"
 Austrian_staff_desc:0 "The Imperial and Royal General Staff of Austria-Hungary was part of the Ministry of War. It was headed by the Chief of the General Staff for the Whole Armed Forces, who had direct access to the Emperor. The general staff was responsible for planning and preparations, while the Armeeoberkommando (AOK) was the operational high command. In fact, since the AOK was under the direct command of the emperor and the chief of the general staff was his chief adviser, in practice the AOK was under the control of the chief of the general staff."
 Franch_Staff:0 "Francuski sztab"
 Franch_Staff_desc:0 "In times of war, the army chief of staff took charge of general headquarters (GQG: Grand Quartier Général). During the First World War, the leader of the French armies was variously referred to as supreme general (generalissimo) or commander-in-chief. In the closing years of the war, the establishment of the Supreme War Council in 1917 led to overall command being held by French general Ferdinand Foch, and by mid-1918 French army chief Pétain was subordinate to Foch. Although the war essentially ended with the armistice in November 1918, the war-time organisation persisted until 1920."
 ENG_Staff:0 "Angielski sztab"
 ENG_Staff_desc:0 "The British Army during World War I could trace its organisation to the increasing demands of imperial expansion. The framework was the voluntary system of recruitment and the regimental system, which had been defined by the Cardwell and Childers Reforms of the late 19th century. The British Army had been prepared and primarily called upon for Empire matters and the ensuing colonial wars.[4] In the last years of the 19th century, the Army was involved in a major conflict, the Second Boer War (1899-1902), which highlighted shortcomings in its tactics, leadership and administration.

 POL_interwar_spirit_WielkopolskaUprising:0 "Bij Bolszewika"
 POL_interwar_spirit_WielkopolskaUprising_desc:0 "With the Second Republic only months old, few accept the idea of losing sovereignty once again. While Poland was looking west to avoid a vengeful Germany, however, Lenin broke his promise declaring the Polish Partition null and began to push in from the east. This has only inflamed the fighting spirit of the Polish people to defend the young nation to the last from the Red invaders."

 GER_interwar_spirit_BannedConscription_desc:0 "With only 100,000 volunteers (and no conscripts) allowed in the army, no submarines or planes, only a few battleships allowed, and even restrictions on small arms, the Treaty of Versailles is a blatant attempt to ensure Germany's military is among the smallest in Europe. The faster the new German government can get around these setbacks- whether by diplomacy, creative bureaucracy, or shadier measures- the faster the nation will be a power once again."

 SOV_interwar_spirit_LeninRedArmy:0 "The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army"
 SOV_interwar_spirit_LeninRedArmy_desc:0 "With fronts all throughout the former Empire against White armies, foreign invasions, and reactionary local governments alike, the Red Army by its nature is mostly made up of untrained or partially trained militia, though the meat of the force is the smaller force of better trained and equipped regulars. This allows Soviet Russia to field a huge army to defend its borders, although plagued by organizational issues and holding only a few divisions truly suited to attack."

 interwar_spirit_TGWWinner_Italy:0 "Jubilation of Victory?"
 interwar_spirit_TGWWinner_Italy_desc:0 "Though few in Italy are complaining about being on the winning side during the Great War, many are complaining about the rather meager compensation Italy ended up with for so many lost- in fact, to the point where even now, anger with the government and former allies as well as political extremism are approaching the same levels as they have in the defeated Central Powers. If this is not tamed, Italy may join the powers seeking revenge."

 interwar_spirit_TheGreatWar_Loser:0 "Shame of Defeat"
 interwar_spirit_TheGreatWar_Loser_desc:0 "The order of the day in this nation is finger pointing between civic and military officials and wide-scale public dissent from the civilian population. Incensed by the humiliating treaties to end the war and the heavy burdens placed on the nation's military and economy, this nation is a hotbed for radicals who seek to overthrow the old order, avenge the loss, and lead the state back to glory. Simply put, the people want to end the sting of the shame of defeat."
